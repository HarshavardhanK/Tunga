    "## The Question\n",
    "Large Language Models perform really well on natural language generation tasks, sometimes equally or surpassing human abilities. Since GPT, natural language processing has seen many advancements, and ChatGPT showcased the power of LLMs on variety of tasks like question answering, generating long texts, and even simple logical reasoning. But, the answers were based out of the parametric memory of the model which was frozen, i.e., it could not update or fetch relevant data. Many a times the LLMs would invent results and output them: they would *hallucinate*. **Is there a way to make large language models fetch relevant information and generate accurate answers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dataset\n",
    "We are utilizing 3 chapters (chapter 1, 2, and 7) of the course textbook 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach' and a couple of slides from Prof. Keogh and Prof. LePendu as our additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Method\n",
    "To achieve our objective of eliminating hallucination and boost relevancy, we utilize Llama-Index, LangChain, and Ollama to build a RAG pipeline. Llama-Index is used to index the documents and store them in a vector database. LangChain serves the local Ollama model of Llama 2 7B. The chapters from the textbook and the slides are index and stored in a vector database which are then retrieved based on the similarity with the query passed to the language model. We have used OpenAI's state-of-the-art text-embedding-ada-002 embedding model through their API. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Our hypothesis\n",
    "We feel that supplementing the LLM with additional context can boost the relevance of the answer and stop it from hallucinating. The evaluation is done using the RAGAS approach where we measure how relevant and consistent the generated result is to the context and the query.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why bother?\n",
    "As the use of LLM is rising, one LLM cannot know everything in this universe. It is important to have specific LLM for a specific purpose. It is also important to have fresh data for the LLM to access and output relevant and factually correct results. The approach of RAG seems promising to alleviate most of the problems related to LLMs generation and correct usage can boost the utilization of the language models in various fields. \n",

      "Adversarial search is a type of search algorithm that assumes there is an adversary in the environment, and it relaxes the assumption of full control over the world. Adversarial search is used in game playing search, where the goal is to find the best move in a game against an opponent. The algorithm starts by evaluating the initial state of the game and then generates the game tree down to the terminal nodes. It applies the utility function to the terminal nodes and passes up the backed-up values to the parent node until it reaches the initial state. The value of the initial state is the minimum score for Max. In summary, adversarial search is a search algorithm that considers the presence of an adversary in the environment and evaluates the best move in a game against an opponent using a utility function.\n"
